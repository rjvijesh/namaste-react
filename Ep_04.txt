1. props
- dynamically pass some data to a component 
- just normal arguments to a function

2. Destructuring on the fly 
props = {resName, cuisine}


3. Config driven UI (system design interview)
control the ui based on the data
UI is basically driven by config


4. array to comma seperated string
const a = ["burger", "snacks"];
console.log(a.join(", "));


5. optional chaining 
var {} = resData.data ? "" : "";
var {} = resData?.data;

6. ADD Key ttribute in a component
=> we must always add a key attribute to every component to uniquely identify the component while rendering
if we don't add key attirbute then React will not able to identify the component and try to re-render the components again, hence adding key attribute will optimize the app.

=>Never add index as a key, as if the items are re-ordered in a array, then the pattern to identify the component is disturbed
