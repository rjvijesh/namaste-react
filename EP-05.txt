//React super powers
1. every thing we can do with React we can also do with HTML,CSS and javascript
React makes your developer experience easy, less code, coding experience very fast
makes large application production ready 


=> React Hooks 


seperate files for seperate components 
break our app into multiple files
don't overthink while starting the app, as we can restructure it anytime later
https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html

folder structure pattern 
 - src


 1st Export and then Import 

 while importing if you don't put extension it will still work


 default export/import 
 when 
 1. default export  export default abcd;
 2. default import  - import name from path;
 

 2 Named export/import 
 1. named export  - export abcd;
 2. named import  - import {name} from path;

 HOME WORK=>can I do default export alongwith a named export 
 YES we can do, I have added default export with named export in RestaurantCard component

feature to huilt top rated restaurant 
 > 4 starts => top rated restaurant

SUPER POWER OF REACT 
=>DOM manipulation
1. updating the DOM manipulation efficiently
2. UI and data layer work in sync 

REACT Hook 
=>A normal JS function given to us by react.

2 important hooks  
1. useState() - generate superpowerful state variables in react 
= Maintains the state variable for the component 
= Whenever a state variable updates, react will re-render the component.
= logic of updating is called re-rendering. 

useEffect()


React uses Re-consiliation algorithm 
=Re-consiliation algorithm  also known as react fiber(React16 introduced)
=when something changes in UI is known as Re-consiliation

Actual DOM <div></div> 
Virtual DOM - representation of actual DOM (normal JS object)

Diffie Algorithm 
find the difference between 2 virtual DOM 
Old virtual DOM and New Virtual DOM

React never touches./updates the Actual HTML and whenever a state variables changes it compares the old virtual DOM(JS object) and new virtual DOM(JS object) and renders the new virtual DOM into the actual DOM replacing the UI

React is doing efficient DOM manipulation
As it has virtual DOM 
Virtual DOM concept existed long back but this concept became popular after react 
Diffie alogorithm

#React Fibre
=The goal of React Fiber is to increase its suitability for areas like animation, layout, and gestures. Its headline feature is incremental rendering: the ability to split rendering work into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames.
=Other key features include the ability to pause, abort, or reuse work as new updates come in; the ability to assign priority to different types of updates; and new concurrency primitives.
